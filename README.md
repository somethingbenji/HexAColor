# HexAColor
## What is it?
HexAColor is an encrypting method that is based off Hex color codes.
For this README, we will use the color code "FFFF00" as an example, which is basic yellow.
If you want to run this, please use your browser to run it, the html provided "Index.html" Is infact for running it easily on the browser or a live server.

Just made for fun, don't expect it to be really secure.
If you have any feedback, comment it.

## Function
This encryption can be used for various things, but mainly would be useful for ARGS.
It's easy to encrypt and decrypt with the key, without it, its way more harder.

### Do it yourself:
This is how to encrypt and decrypt with this code yourself.

* Place your color code on the "Hex color" Input. (Preferably without the #)
